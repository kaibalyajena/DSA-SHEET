GRAPH
- vertices + edges
- represent and analyze complex relationships between entities


TYPES OF GRAPHS
- null graph -- no edges
- trivial graph -- single vertex
- directed graph
- undirected graph
- connected graph -- all nodes reachable from all nodes
- disconnected graph
- regular graph -- degree of each vertex is k
- complete graph -- each node connected to each node
- cycle graph -- the graph is a cycle (degree of each vertex is 2)
- cyclic graph -- graph has atleast one cycle
- directed graph
- weighted graph
- bipartite graph -- graph is 2 colorable -- does not have odd length cycles -- vertices can be divided into two disjoint and independent sets u and v such that every edge connects a vertex in u to a vertex in v


REPRESENTATION
- adjacency matrix -- if edge exists between i and j then a[i][j]=1 and a[j][i]=1 and if no edge then 0. adding and removing edge is constant but initializing is v^2
- adjacency list -- an array of lists of connected vertices. (0->1->2  0 had edges with 1 and 2). adding edges is constant, removing edge and initializing is linear.
- incidence matrix
