LINKED LIST INTRODUCTION
-linear data structure
-nodes stored in non contiguous memory locations
-nodes connecter using pointers
-a node contains a data field and pointer to / address of the next node (singly linked ll)

NEED / ADVANTAGES
-dynamic - the memory can be allocated and deallocated at run time according to the type of operation
-easy insertion and deletion (no shifting like in arrays) (only address updations)
-efficient memory allocation
-many data structures can be implemented (stack,queue,graph,hashmap etc.)

DISADVANTAGES
-random access (no direct access using index) (need to traverse) (costly search operation)
-extra memory to store pointers

TYPES
-single linked list (next pointer)
-double linked list (next and prev pointer)
-circular linked list (last node connected to first)

REAL WORLD APPLICATIONS
-music player (prev and next songs)
-web browser (prev and next web pages)
-image viewer
-places where data is stored in an alphabetical order
